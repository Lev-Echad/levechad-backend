Routes to implement:

Help form routes:
GET /help/shopping
    /help/commute
    /help/meds
    /help/phone_support
    /help/home
    /help/other
Each of these routes should render the help.html template, while passing a different form object as a paramter.

Registration routes:
POST /register_volunteer
     /register_help
both routes receive the respective form data in the request body.
